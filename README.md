Pale is a python API layer, named after the P in IPA.


It's designed to make implementing and maintaining APIs easy, with convenient
support for versioning, generating documentation from code, and modularity.

Pale is framework-independent, and should be usable with Flask and webapp2


### Status

Pale is currently in an early pre-release state, but we've decided to
open it up now anyways.  As we progress, the interfaces for using Pale
will stabilize, and we'll get our unit tests up to snuff so that you'll
feel confident using Pale in your own projects.
